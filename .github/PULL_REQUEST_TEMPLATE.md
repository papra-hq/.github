## About vibe-coded contributions

- Please be aware that vibe-coded contribution are **prohibited**.
- We are human behind open source projects, trying hard to maintain and improve them.
- Vibe-coded contributions tend to pollute the codebase and they drain a lot of time and energy from maintainers to review and fix them.
- The maintenance burden created by vibe-coded contributions falls entirely on maintainers.

-> Vibe-coded PRs will be rejected, and repeated offenses may lead to a ban from contributing to our projects.

## About new features or enhancements

- New features or changes should be discussed in an issue before being implemented.
- Discussions help ensure that the proposed changes align with the project's vision and goals, and they allow for feedback and suggestions from the community.
- Please create an issue to discuss your proposed changes before submitting a pull request.
- Also note that an open issue does not mean that the requested feature or change will be accepted or we are willing to have it in the project.

-> Pull requests that introduce un-discussed features or changes may be rejected until the discussion has taken place.
